## Abstract
This paper examines the ethical challenges posed by artificial intelligence in the context of unfair commercial practices, focusing on real-world cases such as the AGCM Italy decision and OECD policy analysis. It explores how AI-driven profiling, manipulation, and opaque data practices impact user autonomy, privacy, and societal trust. Using frameworks from privacy theory, behavioral economics, and surveillance capitalism, the analysis highlights risks related to consent, transparency, and power asymmetries. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy, design, and enforcement to mitigate harms and promote responsible AI use in commercial contexts.

## Scope and Case Context
This work analyzes the AGCM Italy Facebook case and OECD AI ethics case studies, focusing on data harvesting, consent quality, transparency, dark patterns, targeted persuasion, and their societal impact.

## Methodology
This study uses case analysis informed by policy documents and scholarship, conceptual ethical evaluation with established frameworks, and a literature-backed discussion of long-term societal impacts and policy options.

## Key Findings
- Consent and transparency: Disclosures often fail contextual integrity; users cannot reasonably infer flows or downstream uses.
- Manipulation risks: Personalized interfaces and dark patterns can undermine autonomy and informed choice.
- Asymmetries and externalities: Platform data advantages create power imbalances with societal spillovers, not just individual harms.
- Long-term impacts: Normalization of pervasive profiling risks chilling effects on expression, consumer exploitation, and erosion of trust.

## Recommendations
- Context-appropriate transparency and consent aligned with data use contexts.
- Guardrails on persuasive targeting and design patterns with material behavioral impact.
- Data minimization, purpose limitation, and robust access/portability.
- Independent audits, impact assessments, and enforcement with deterrent penalties.
- User agency tools (explanations, opt-out, control over profiling) and redress mechanisms.
